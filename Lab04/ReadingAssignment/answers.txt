If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
-> It will make an error.

What class should implement the Comparable interface?
-> Media.

In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
-> 
public int compareTo(Media media) {
        return this.getCost() - media.getCost;
    }

Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
-> No.

Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
-> By using if/else, in first case, if 2 objects have the same title, we compare them by length and so on.
