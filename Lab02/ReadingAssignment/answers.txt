Question 1: When should accessor methods be used?
- Answer: When you need methods to return the value of a private variable and gives other classes access to that value stored in that variable, without having direct access to the variable itself.

Question 2: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
- Answer: Yes, this is called "Method overloading" (Methods in a class might have the same name but different signatures).
